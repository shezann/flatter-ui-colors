A clone of Flat UI Colors using React and Ant Design for React.  I used this as a project to get familiar with working on a large project and react-router-dom. I used the palettes from the original Flat UI Colors and added these extra features: 

1. Go into more detail for each color
2. Create your own palette
3. Sync with local storage to store your palettes

## Credits

[Colt Steele's](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/) Udemy Course was an enormous help in me learning about React and getting this project done. He did this project in his course using React Class Components and Material UI. I used some logic and the base color palette from his project but all other code is mine. 

This project would not have been possible without these amazing npm packages: 

1. [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
2. [Chroma.js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/)
3. [Emoji-mart](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart)
4. [react-sortable-hoc](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc)
5. [react-copy-to-clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-copy-to-clipboard)
6. [react-material-ui-form-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-material-ui-form-validator)
7. [react-transition-group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/)
